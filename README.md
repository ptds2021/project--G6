# Interactive Shiny App: Ecological Footprint of countries' production surface areas (by year)

## Context

In the last decades, with the rise of global warming and natural disasters, there is an urgent need to reduce our individual ecological footprint. By now, we are aware that by reducing our overall consumption, shift our purchasing habits and so on, we can globally contribute to a common goal: a cleaner planet.

## Package Content

The following piece of work creates a package called **G6** providing five functions (four functions are specific to our package  and one function is to launch the shiny app) and a shiny app:

* G6_stats: The function returns a table displaying statistics for one or more selected countries. 

* map_overview: The function returns an interactive World map (of available countries) displaying the total ecological footprint of different production sites by selected record type. 

* sustainability: The function returns a bar plot showing the yearly difference between the biocapacity (in gha) per capita and the ecological footprint of production (in gha) per capita.

* timeseries: The function returns times series of the evolution of different production surface areas' ecological footprints over the years for one or more selected countries. The plot can display some forecasting if the user selects the option to do so.

Shiny app that will gather worldwide data on carbon emissions caused by different types of production lands and exploit the information to produce visual outcomes enabling a user to look for specific information by country and by year, and allowing comparisons by country or region. 

This tool will be able to help spreading awareness and understand the gravity and urgency of undertaking immediate long-lasting actions against climate change, as well as making data research more convenient for those needing it.

This project is still at its starting point, only the Project Proposal has been made for now.

## Documentation

The documentation of each function was generated by running **roxygen** using the *devtools::document()* function and produced five corresponding .Rd files and a NAMESPACE file. 

## Check

If you run the *devtools::check()* function in the console you obtain the result of the full R CMD check of the package **G6**. The results show that there are no errors and no warnings, indicating that the package works well without any significant issue. However, the result indicates one note telling us that the *installed size is 7.1Mb* and that the *sub-directories of 1Mb or more : extdata 7.0Mb*. Following some research on this note, we learn that it has to do with the size of the data imported which exceeds a certain accepted threshold. Therefore, we will try to reduce the size of the .csv file in **/extdata**. Note that if the note remains when you run the check it means we did not manage to solve the issue.
