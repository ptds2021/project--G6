All of us are aware of the urgent need to reduce our individual ecological footprint by reducing our overall consumption, shift our purchasing habits, recycle more, invest in renewable energies and globally contribute to a common goal: a cleaner planet. Even though world leaders gather to unify and work as a united front towards sustainable changes with the ultimate goal to slow climate change, we still currently detect many unresolved issues regarding the topic of sustainability. 

Firstly, we understand that many aspects of sustainability are not well understood. Indeed, it is associated with many difficult terms (e.g. bio capacity, life-cycle analysis, embodied energy, footprint intensity, etc.) that non-specialists do not necessarily grasp. Because the average layman does not necessarily understand these terms and is sometimes overwhelmed by the overload of information in the News, individuals tend to completely turn away from reflecting about it. 

Secondly, it is not immediately obvious how our individual daily actions (e.g. limit water use waste, riding a bike over driving a car) fit in the overall picture of the community, country and the World. 

Thirdly, sustainability data is scattered among all kinds of media in a "fuzzy" way. Oftentimes when doing research about the topic, one ends up being constantly redirected to more and more sources that are not necessarily mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

To address the above points and challenges, we want to create the S(ust)hinybility app based on a reliable database. This app aims at gathering worldwide data on carbon emissions caused by different types of production lands and exploit the information to produce visual outcomes enabling a user to look for specific information by country and by year. Therefore, the app will provide visualization to compare carbon emissions on a country (or region) level and understand the gravity and urgency of undertaking immediate long-lasting actions against climate change. 

The app aims to to have an impact on three different levels. First, the individuals are nudged to learn about ecological footprint. This increases knowledge and awareness and helps to make more informed decisions later on. Second, making ecological footprints comparable between countries helps to filter certain criteria and makes research more convenient. Here, the impact is a higher satisfaction of researchers looking for countries' involvement and responsibility towards sustainable changes. Third, the interactive app helps to track and trace developments. This tool could be a fact checker and used against wrongly spread information over the Internet in either way..</p>
