# Motivation

Package **G6** results from our interest in visualizing the impact of production (respectively consumption) on climate's deterioration in the past 50 years throughout the world. The climate crisis is the direct consequence of the environmental resources' over-consumption. Since the industrial revolution, innovations pushed industries to always consume more without anticipating facing limited resources and without considering their impact on the environment. Much later with the rise of impressive technological advancements, we have come to the realization that we have taken clean land, air, and water for granted and have damaged the abilities of land, air, and water to absorb society's waste products.

Package G6 uses an external data base collecting information on some countries' Ecological Footprint over the past 55 years to display the consumption habits of populations. The functionalities of the package show the global decline in responsibility and its impact on the planet.
