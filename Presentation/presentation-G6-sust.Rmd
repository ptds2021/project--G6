```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Context

-   Rise in ecological concerns

-   World leaders meetings to bring that topic further and take measures

-   Heavy political discussions and debates dividing the population

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("recyc2.jpeg")
```


## Agenda

-   Identified pain points
-   Goals and Impact
-   Data
-   Sustainability App
-   Limitations &Learnings 
-   Conclusion

## Identfied pain points

-   **Uneducated population:** Many aspects of sustainability are not well understood

-   **Lack of transparency:** Not immediately obvious how our personal immediate actions fit the overall picture

-   **Scattered data:** Sustainability data is scattered among all kinds of media in a "fuzzy" way.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Footprint-highres.png")
```

## Goals

To address the above points and challenges, we want to create the S(ust)hinybility app based on a reliable database. This app

-   **gathers** worldwide data on carbon emissions

-   **exploits** the specific information by year and by country

-   **provides** visualization to compare carbon emissions on a country (or region) level

## Impact

::: columns-2
**First:** the individuals are nudged to learn

**Second:** making ecological footprints comparable

**Third:** the interactive app helps to check facts and used against wrongly spread information

-   Increases knowledge and awareness

-   Higher satisfaction of researchers

-   This increases data credibility
:::

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Reduce-Your-Carbon-Footprint.jpg")
```

## Data

-   *Source:* 2019 edition of the *National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts*

-   *Variables:* The (public) data set has 12 variables and provide information on 72,186 observations on 192 countries

-   *Time frame:* 1961 - 2016

## Important terms

-   **Ecological Footprint**

-   **Biocapacity**

-   **Carbon Footprint**

## Sustshinability App

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="World Map Overview"}
knitr::include_graphics("newplot.png")
```


## Ecological Balance (2)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Overview Ecological Balance FR, BEL, GER, CH."}
knitr::include_graphics("stats1.png")
```



## Statistics (3)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Statistics FR, BEL, GER, CH."}
knitr::include_graphics("sust1.png")
```


## Time Series (4)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Time Series FR, BEL, GER, CH."}
knitr::include_graphics("ts.png")
```

## Website 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ws.png")
```


## Limitations

-   **Project management:** Starting ideas too optimistic and not realistic for timeframe of class schedule

-   **Data:** Generality of dataset, understanding of data and selection bias

-   **Covid-19:** Lost unnecessary time due to remote working 

## Learnings

-   **(1)** Conversion of ideas into code is time consuming (and fixing errors or deleting websites)
-   **(2)** GitHUb is quite useful for group projects and time-saving
-   **(3)** The bottlenecks of projects are usually fixing errors and checking the package
-   **(4)** To-Do lists and Github Projects help to track progress and have a clear view of the project

## Conclusion

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
Improvements for package :

- Reduce the data size and computational time

- More complex shiny app
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
We achieved our goals ! : 

- We managed to exploits these information to provide educational content for peoples
 
- Visualization is created thanks to our shiny app

- We gathered a torough database
</div>


## Thank you for your attention
