# Description

The function returns a bar plot showing the difference per year between the biocapacity (in gha) per capita and the ecological footprint of production (in gha) per capita. Each bar shows then a sustainability value which can be positive or negative. If the value is positive, this means that a country for one year is sustainable (i.e. it has more biocapacity than what it actually uses).

# Shiny App

The use can choose one or more countries and compare their sustainability score (i.e. ecological balance).
