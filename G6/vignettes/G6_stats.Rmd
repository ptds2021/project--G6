The purpose of the function *G6_stats()* is to compute the "sustainability score" that we defined as the difference between Biocapacity per Capita of a country and the Ecological Footrpint of Consumption per Capita.

The arguments of the function are country names. 

If the score is negative, it means that the country consume more resources than the land is able to provide to the country.
