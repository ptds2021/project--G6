# Interactive Shiny App: Carbon Emissions by Country and by Year

In the last decades, with the rise of global warming and natural disasters, there is an urgent need to reduce our individual ecological footprint by reducing our overall consumption, shift our purchasing habits and so on, in order to globally contribute to a common goal: a cleaner planet.
The following piece of work aims to create a Shiny app that will gather worldwide data on carbon emissions caused by different types of production lands and exploit the information to produce visual outcomes enabling a user to look for specific information by country and by year, and allowing comparisons by country or region. 

This tool will be able to help spreading awareness and understand the gravity and urgency of undertaking immediate long-lasting actions against climate change, as well as making data research more convenient for those needing it.

This project is still at its starting point, only the Project Proposal has been made for now.
